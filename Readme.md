<h1> 📌 Programming logic exercises 👨‍💻💻📚 </h1>

Welcome to my Beecrowd exercises repository. First of all, in my repository, have several exercises solved in the C# language. Remembering that I'm still perfecting myself in programming, more specifically in the C# language. Anyway, I hope this repository is useful in some way to anyone.

<h2> 📌 List of exercises separated by topics (With the problem of the question) </h2>

* Exercises List - Conditional Structures ✅
* Exercices List - Sequential Structures ✅
* Exercices List - Repetitive Structures ✅

<h2> 📌 About the URI </h2>

The URI website is now called beecrowd. The [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/) is a site for solving programming problems that involve exercises separated by topics and levels. For this reason, the site is highly recommended for beginners. In addition, the site has a super interesting competitive scheme that allows coders to accumulate points. In this way, the site becomes indispensable for those who want to improve in programming.

<h2> 📌 Udemy Course - Logic Exercises (Adapted)

</h2>

Here, I put a folder with a list of exercises from the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/logica-de-programacao-csharp/">programming logic</a> course by Professor Nélio Alves. However, I adapted it my way for better accessibility to the exercises. In each folder (Sequential / Conditional / Repetitive), inside the Program.cs file, of each specific folder, there are two implemented methods that are inside the "ListaDeExercicios" file. One to display the exercises menu and the other allows the user to choose which problem they want to view.
